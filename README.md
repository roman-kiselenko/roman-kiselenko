      Hi! I’m a <code>Platform Engineer</code> / <code>DevOps</code> / <code>Golang Engineer</code> passionate about building and scaling infrastructure on <code>Kubernetes</code>.<br/><br/>Over the years, I’ve worked with on-prem and cloud clusters (<code>AWS</code>, <code>GCP</code>, <code>OpenShift</code>, <code>K3s</code>), designed reliable CI/CD pipelines, managed infrastructure with <code>Terraform</code>, <code>Ansible</code>, <code>KubeSpray</code>, <code>Kubeadm</code>, and ensured secure, resilient networking with <code>Calico</code>, <code>Cilium</code>, <code>Istio</code>, and <code>MetalLB</code>.<br/>
    <br/>I’m also an active open source contributor in the <code>Kubernetes</code> ecosystem, enjoying sharing knowledge and helping improve community tools. I develop internal automation tools in <code>Golang</code> to simplify workflows and enhance cluster management.<br/><br/>
    Outside of work, I’m a husband and father, balancing my career with family life and personal projects.
