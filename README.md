<p> Hey! </p>
<p>As a devoted father, loving husband, and passionate programmer, I wear many hats! My main focus is on <code>Golang</code>, but I also enjoy working with <code>Python</code>, <code>JavaScript</code>, and <code>Bourne shell</code>. I've gathered valuable experience in various cloud service models, including <code>SaaS</code>, <code>PaaS</code>, and <code>IaaS</code>. I'm quite skilled in <code>Kubernetes</code> and have had the pleasure of hands-on experience in both deployment and management, which has been an exciting journey!</p>
